<h1>My javascript home education</h1>
<p>Here I am following along with <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JS30</a>'s tutorials and uploading things to a github repo so that a friend and I can learn and share</p>
<a href="01drumkit/index.html">Exercise 01 - Javascript drum kit</a>
<a href="02clock/index.html">Exercise 02 - JS/CSS clock</a>, with plenty of modified CSS to distinguish the hands better.
